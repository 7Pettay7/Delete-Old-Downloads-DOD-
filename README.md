# Delete Old Downloads (DOD)

Delete Old Downloads, or DOD, is a script written in PowerShell to delete your old downloads after a specified number of days. The default amount of days old a download must be to get deleted is 90 days, but it can be changed in the script to any number.

DOD also includes a feature that can send an email of what downloads were deleted in HTML format. You must edit the 'DOD.ps1' file to include a sending email address, the senders password, a receiving address, the SMTP server URL, and port number. To make sure you can properly test your email settings, there is a "-WhatIf" parameter in the function where the downloads deletion executes. Remove the parameter once done testing to have the program delete files.

The easiest way to automate this script is to create scheduled task in Windows. To create a scheduled task, see the guide below to get started.

***Please note that PowerShell does not send files/folders to the Recycle Bin, it deletes them entirely. Use this program with caution if there may be files/folders you would like to keep in your downloads folder***
